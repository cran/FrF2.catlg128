Description: Catalogues of resolution IV regular
        fractional factorial designs in 128 runs are provided 
        for up to 33 2-level factors. The catalogues are complete, 
        excluding resolution IV designs without 5-letter words, 
        because these do not add value for a search for unblocked 
        clear designs. The previous package version
        1.0 with complete catalogues up to 24 runs (24 runs and a
        namespace added later) can be downloaded from the authors
        website.
